const data=["Class is a user-defined data type which defines its properties and its functions. Class is the only logical representation of the data. For example Human being is a class. The body parts of a human being are its properties, and the actions performed by the body parts are known as functions.The class does not occupy any memory space till the time an object is instantiated","Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts defined below" , "Object is a run-time entity. It is an instance of the class. An object can represent a person place or any other item. An object can operate on both data members and member functions" , "Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). With polymorphiseach of these classes will have different underlying data. Precisely Poly means many and morphism means forms" , "Method overloading is a technique which allows you to have more than one function with the same function name but with different functionality. Method overloading can be possible on the following basis" ,"polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism. Function overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism. Function overriding means when the child class contains the method which is already present in the parent class. Hence the child class overrides the method of the parent class. In case of function overriding, parent and child classes both contain the same function with a different definition. The call to the function is determined at runtime is known as runtime polymorphism" ,"Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such a way you can reuse extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other classes" ,"Encapsulation is the process of combining data and functions into a single unit called class. In Encapsulation, the data is not accessed directlyit is accessed through the functions present inside the class. In simpler words, attributes of the class are kept private and public getter and setter methods are provided to manipulate these attributes. Thus, encapsulation makes the concept of data hiding possible.Data hiding a language feature to restrict access to members of an object, reducing the negative effect due to dependenciesfeature in Java)."]
